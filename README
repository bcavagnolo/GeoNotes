Introduction
============

GeoNotes is a simple application that I am developing to learn about web-based
GIS.  This is its primary purpose, so don't expect anything impressively
innovative here.  Its other purposes are to store, retrieve, and share
geo-referenced digital information in a user-friendly fashion.  Here are the
basic use cases:

1. Upload an arbitrary text note with associated location (a GeoNote) from a
   web client to a database from a map-based interface

2. View and retrieve stored GeoNotes from a web client in a map-based interface

3. GeoNotes uploaded by one user should appear or otherwise be available on
   other users' active web clients

Running GeoNotes
================

For development, you probably want to run GeoNotes on your localhost.  Here's
how I set that up on my Ubuntu machine:

1. [more to come.  Migrating to python]

2. Get the code and install the dependencies:

   $ git clone git://github.com/bcavagnolo/GeoNotes.git
   $ cd GeoNotes
   [ more to come ]

3. Launch the app:

Automated Staging Deploy
========================

I use and Ubuntu server on the Internet to stage GeoNotes.  Let's call this
machine staging.com in these instructions.

1. Login to staging.com and set up node from source as described above

2. Set up the hudson build server.  I just happen to run mine on the same
   Ubuntu server, but you could run it anywhere.  I'll leave it to you to
   figure out how to set up hudson and create a job for GeoNotes.  For your
   reference, here are the commands that I have the hudson server running:

   Note that I had to set the system git configuration so hudson could tag the
   tree:

   $ sudo git config --system user.email "hudson@localhost"
   $ sudo git config --system user.name "Hudson"

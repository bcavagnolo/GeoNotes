Introduction
============

GeoNotes is a simple application that I am developing to learn about web-based
GIS.  This is its primary purpose, so don't expect anything impressively
innovative here.  Its other purposes are to store, retrieve, and share
geo-referenced digital information in a user-friendly fashion.  Here are the
basic use cases:

1. Upload an arbitrary text note with associated location (a GeoNote) from a
   web client to a database from a map-based interface

2. View and retrieve stored GeoNotes from a web client in a map-based interface

3. GeoNotes uploaded by one user should appear or otherwise be available on
   other users' active web clients
